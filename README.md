## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

### IMPORTANT Testing static pages
 - Have not installed loaders for static css,
 - Have not installed loaders for static bootstrap
 - run yarn/ npm generate 
 - go in /dist folder and drag the any .html page to the browser.
 - to have this we will need change to plugins
 - find a way to load bootstrap statically
 - find how to load scss statically
